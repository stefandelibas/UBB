Problem:
	Consider a system to control a sprinkler.
	The purpose of this system is to adjust the operating time of the sprinkler (short, medium, long).
	The outside sensors give information about the air temperature(very cold,cold,normal,warm,hot)
	and the humidity of the soil(dry,normal,wet).
	Compute the necessary operating time of the sprinkler according to the input data

Input:
	Temperature:
		very cold
		cold
		normal
		warm
		hot
	Humidity:
		dry
		normal 
		wet
	
Output:
	Time of the sprinkle:
		short
		medium
		long
		
Algorithm:
	Mamdami model
	Defuzzification: Largest of maximum
